**Why choose AWS S3 as the target for AWS DMS?**
AWS S3 is chosen as a target for AWS DMS because it provides scalability, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility for storing large volumes of data. It enables data 
lakes, analytics, and machine learning, supports multiple formats (CSV, Parquet, JSON), and integrates seamlessly with AWS services like Athena, Glue, and 
Redshift.
