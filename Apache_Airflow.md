**Why to use Apache Airflow instead of AWS Glue?**
Airflow supports custom Python scripts, REST APIs, and shell commands.
âœ” Glue is limited to Spark-based ETL jobs and doesnâ€™t handle complex workflows well.

ðŸ“Œ Use Case: If you need to integrate with databases, APIs, and third-party tools beyond Glue's capabilities, Airflow is better.
