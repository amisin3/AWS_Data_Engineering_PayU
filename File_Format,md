How to choose between different file formats - 
1. Faster reads
2. Faster writes
3. Splitable (Most important features needed for parallelism)
4. Schema evolution support (Adding or removing the columns from the existing file)
5. Advanced compression (row based are bad for compression and column based are good for compression)
6. Most compatible platform
7. Predicate Pushdown is a query optimization technique used in databases and data processing engines (like Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and others) to improve 
query performance by pushing filtering conditions (predicates) closer to the data source. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be read and processed, 
leading to faster query execution.

All the file formats are divided into 2 broad categories - 
1. Row based (writing is easy)
2. Column based (faster reads)

-- Text File Fomrat 
Not to be used in production
Eg- txt, csv, json, xml

-- Row based file format
1. Avro
- Schema is stored in json
- Actual data is stored in a binary format
- Best file format for schema evolution
- Best for write heavy task

-- Column based file format
1. ORC (Optimized Row Columnar)
- Compression works really well here
- Provides a predicate pushdown
2. Parquet
